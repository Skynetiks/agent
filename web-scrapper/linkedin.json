      "text": "You set up a WhatsApp Business campaign, expecting a predictable cost. But when the bill arrives, it’s way higher than expected. Sound familiar?\n\nA client recently came to us, confused about why their WhatsApp marketing costs had skyrocketed. After reviewing their campaign, two key issues stood out:\n1️⃣ Marketing templates are expensive. WhatsApp charges different rates for different types of messages. Marketing templates cost significantly more than utility or service messages. Sending bulk promotional messages without optimizing can quickly inflate costs.\n2️⃣ Hidden platform fees. Many third-party providers add an overhead fee per message—sometimes without making it clear. These extra charges can pile up, making each message far more expensive than WhatsApp’s base pricing.\n\n🚀 How to avoid unnecessary charges?\n ✔️ Use conversational messaging where possible to stay within session-based pricing.\n ✔️ Optimize marketing templates to reduce unnecessary messages.\n ✔️ Be aware of platform fees—choose a provider that offers transparent pricing.\n\nHave you noticed unexpected WhatsApp charges?

      "text": "Imagine this: You’ve spent hours crafting the perfect marketing email. The subject line is catchy, the content is compelling, and the CTA is strong. You hit send on Saturday morning, hoping to capture attention over the weekend. But instead of clicks and conversions, your email drowns in the abyss of unread messages.\n\nWe ran an experiment with two identical email campaigns—one sent on a Saturday, the other on a Tuesday. The difference? The Tuesday email had 42% higher open rates and 58% more clicks.\n\nHere’s why weekends are the worst time to send marketing emails:\n1️⃣ People aren’t in “work mode.” Most professionals disconnect, and even for B2C, weekends are about relaxation, not reading promotional emails.\n2️⃣ Inbox competition is tougher on Monday. By the time people check their emails, yours is buried under weekend clutter.\n3️⃣ Lower engagement signals hurt deliverability. ISPs notice when emails get ignored, increasing the chances of landing in spam.\n\nInstead, aim for mid-week sends—Tuesday to Thursday often perform best. And always test different time slots based on your audience’s behavior.\n\nHave you noticed a difference in email engagement on weekends vs. weekdays?

They needed to change public perception fast.\n\nThe Genius Move:\n✅ A globally adaptable slogan: “I’m Lovin’ It” worked across languages and cultures.\n ✅ A catchy jingle: Co-created by Pharrell Williams and Justin Timberlake, the jingle was first released as a pop song before becoming an ad.\n ✅ Consistency: McDonald’s used the tagline across every ad, commercial, and campaign for 20+ years.\n\nThe Impact:\n🚀 The campaign ran in 120+ countries, making it McDonald’s most successful branding effort ever.\n 🚀 It reversed McDonald's declining sales and made the brand more relatable to younger audiences.\n 🚀 Even today, you instantly recognize “Ba da ba ba ba…” That’s branding at its finest!\n\nMarketing Lessons:\n💡 A great jingle = free advertising.
