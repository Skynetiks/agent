      "text": "You set up a WhatsApp Business campaign, expecting a predictable cost. But when the bill arrives, it‚Äôs way higher than expected. Sound familiar?\n\nA client recently came to us, confused about why their WhatsApp marketing costs had skyrocketed. After reviewing their campaign, two key issues stood out:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Marketing templates are expensive. WhatsApp charges different rates for different types of messages. Marketing templates cost significantly more than utility or service messages. Sending bulk promotional messages without optimizing can quickly inflate costs.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Hidden platform fees. Many third-party providers add an overhead fee per message‚Äîsometimes without making it clear. These extra charges can pile up, making each message far more expensive than WhatsApp‚Äôs base pricing.\n\nüöÄ How to avoid unnecessary charges?\n ‚úîÔ∏è Use conversational messaging where possible to stay within session-based pricing.\n ‚úîÔ∏è Optimize marketing templates to reduce unnecessary messages.\n ‚úîÔ∏è Be aware of platform fees‚Äîchoose a provider that offers transparent pricing.\n\nHave you noticed unexpected WhatsApp charges?

      "text": "Imagine this: You‚Äôve spent hours crafting the perfect marketing email. The subject line is catchy, the content is compelling, and the CTA is strong. You hit send on Saturday morning, hoping to capture attention over the weekend. But instead of clicks and conversions, your email drowns in the abyss of unread messages.\n\nWe ran an experiment with two identical email campaigns‚Äîone sent on a Saturday, the other on a Tuesday. The difference? The Tuesday email had 42% higher open rates and 58% more clicks.\n\nHere‚Äôs why weekends are the worst time to send marketing emails:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ People aren‚Äôt in ‚Äúwork mode.‚Äù Most professionals disconnect, and even for B2C, weekends are about relaxation, not reading promotional emails.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Inbox competition is tougher on Monday. By the time people check their emails, yours is buried under weekend clutter.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Lower engagement signals hurt deliverability. ISPs notice when emails get ignored, increasing the chances of landing in spam.\n\nInstead, aim for mid-week sends‚ÄîTuesday to Thursday often perform best. And always test different time slots based on your audience‚Äôs behavior.\n\nHave you noticed a difference in email engagement on weekends vs. weekdays?
